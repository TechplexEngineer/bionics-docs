# Leadership Role
Leadership roles are mentor assigined with input from the team via a secret ballot poll. The mentors work to make the best selections for the success of the team. The mentors take many aspects into account, including attentance from the prior season. 

## Robot Lead(s)
Work closely with build leads to ensure their designs are well integrated, buildable, maintainable and robust. Robot Project Management, structure, schedule and execute.

## Team Operations Lead
Work closely with all team members to facilitate communication, awards, outreach, fundraising. Operations Project Management, structure, schedule and execute.

## Software Lead
Software is what separates GOOD teams from GREAT teams. The software lead works closely with the build leads and electrical lead to understand how the robot will work, what motors and sensors are needed to achieve the goals. The software lead also works to balance development time between robot code and scouting system projects both need to be achieved with limited time and resources.

## Build Leads
There would be multiple build leads, one per major subsystem (for example: Drivetrain, Elevator, Manipulator, Climber) who work with a team of 3-5 team members and a mentor to design and build and integrate their subsystem with the other subsystems.
