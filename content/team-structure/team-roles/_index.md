## Leadership Roles
Leadership roles are mentor assigined with input from the team via a secret ballot poll. The mentors work to make the best selections for the success of the team. The mentors take many aspects into account, including attentance from the prior season. 

### Robot Lead(s)
Work closely with build leads to ensure their designs are well integrated, buildable, maintainable and robust. Robot Project Management, structure, schedule and execute.

### Team Operations Lead
Work closely with all team members to facilitate communication, awards, outreach, fundraising. Operations Project Management, structure, schedule and execute.

### Software Lead
Software is what separates GOOD teams from GREAT teams. The software lead works closely with the build leads and electrical lead to understand how the robot will work, what motors and sensors are needed to achieve the goals. The software lead also works to balance development time between robot code and scouting system projects both need to be achieved with limited time and resources.

### Build Leads
There would be multiple build leads, one per major subsystem (for example: Drivetrain, Elevator, Manipulator, Climber) who work with a team of 3-5 team members and a mentor to design and build and integrate their subsystem with the other subsystems.

## Supporting Roles
These roles encompass many of the responsibilities that are needed for a successful build and competition season.

### Equipment Manager
Can't build a robot without tools. This person keeps track of what tools we have, tooling for the CNC machines and broken tools needing replacement. Ensures that the toolbox is prepared for competitions. 

### Ordering/Sourcing Manager
Organize the ordering process. As build leads determine parts needed, generate an order sheet and let the mentors know when orders are ready to be placed. Oversees pre-season inventory to inform ordering decisions to ensure sufficient raw materials available to build competitive robots.

### Competition & Logistics Manager
This person works closely with the Equipment Manager and the Pit Crew to ensure the team is ready for competitions which includes:
Packing Robot, Tools and spare parts
- Team members have appropriate paperwork turned in (field trip forms, STIMS, etc.)
- Team participation at events
- Team Roster for events


### CAD Manager
Keep the CAD organized, periodically create version restore points. Leading CAD training in the pre-season. Ensuring best naming and design practices are followed.

### Game Piece Construction Manager
Every year FIRST releases a set of team drawings. We have been fortunate to have fantastic mentors build the game pieces. This person works with the team constructing the game pieces to determine what subset of the full set of game pieces are needed given the robot design choices.

## Competition Roles
At competition some team members have additional responsibilities.

### Drive Coach
This person is responsible for implementing the teams strategy both by ensuring there is sufficient practice time and supporting the drivers at competitions by developing an alliance strategy with alliance members before each match. A critical function is during the match determining if a change in strategy is required and clearly communicating that change among the alliance members. This position requires a tryout and a rules test.

### Driver
This person is behind the wheel (gamepad, joystick) and works closely with the software team to develop an interface (which buttons and axes to use) to drive the robot. This position requires a tryout and a rules test.

### Operator
This person is behind the (other) wheel (gamepad, joystick) and works closely with the software team to develop an interface (which buttons and axes to use) to control the robot. This position requires a tryout and a rules test.

### Human Player
Most likely there will be a human player position. More details will be known when the game is released. Often the human player gets to manipulate game pieces, feed them to robots and/or collect them from scoring goals.

### Technician
The technician provides the drive team with a technical resource for pre-match setup, robot connectivity, operator console troubleshooting, and post-match removal of the robot. (See the [game manual][1] for more). This position requires a technical test.
