We created a two part tread template to make drilling holes in the tread repeatable.

Tread is 1.5" wide and 11" long. Can be source from:
- Andymark sells the tread in 10' spools [am-4206](https://www.andymark.com/products/blue-nitrile-roughtop-tread-1-5-in-wide-10-ft-long)
- McMaster (3" wide requires cutting) [5994K9-5994K851](https://www.mcmaster.com/5994K9-5994K851/)

Template is made from .25" Lexan cut on CNC and glued together with CA Glue (aka. super glue).

Steps:
1. Cut tread to 11" length. We found tin snips work really well.
2. Insert tread into template with backing against bottom lexan plate
3. Clamp tread between scrap wood and template, drill through the tread
4. Use a non-ball-end hex driver to install tread. Be careful not to crossthread. Chase threads with tap if needed.
