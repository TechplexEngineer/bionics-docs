## Purpose
A drill press is a machine designed to produce holes. They use the rotational motion of a bit, secured in a spindle, to remove material and produce a hole in a work piece. Drill presses operate on a similar premise to hand drills, but they have more power and use a table to support the workpiece while drilling. Generally, the table is situated perpendicularly to the spindle, which ensures that the placement of holes is perpendicular to the top surface of a workpiece. However, the table has the ability to tilt to the left and right to produce holes at a preset angles.

## Safety
1. Always hold work in a vise or clamp to the drill table.
2. Remove chips with a brush, never by hand.
3. Ease up on drilling pressure as the drill starts to break through the bottom of the material.
4. Don't use a dull, cracked or broken drill. Inspect the drill before using.
5. Don't drill with too much pressure.
6. Always try to support part on parallels or a backing board when drilling thru material.
7. Never try to loosen the drill chuck while the power is on.
8. Never clean a machine while it is in motion!!
9. If the drill binds in a hole, stop the machine and turn the spindle backwards by hand to release the bit.
10. When drilling a deep hole withdraw the drill bit frequently to clear chips and lubricate the bit.
11. Always remove the drill chuck key from the spindle immediately after using it.
12. Wear safety eye protection while drilling.
13. Let the spindle stop of its own accord after turning the power off. Never try to stop the spindle with your hand.
