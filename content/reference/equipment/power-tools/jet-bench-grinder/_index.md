## Purpose
A bench grinder drives an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool. Grinding is often used to finish workpieces by removing sharp burrs and edges.

We configure our bench grinder with two different types of wheels. The wheel on the **Right Side** is for rough grinding steel and other ferrus metals. The wheel on the **Left Side** is an silicon carbide deburring wheel.

## Safety
1. Wear goggles or face shield over safety glasses when grinding on bench or pedestal grinders.
2. Toolrests on bench or pedestal grinders shall be set no more than 1/16 inch from the wheel.
3. Never use a wheel that has been dropped or received a heavy blow, even though there may be no apparent damage. Such wheels may be weakened or unbalanced enough to fly apart on startup.
4. Stand to one side when starting a grinding machine. Damaged wheels will sometimes fly apart, and this is most likely to happen when the machine is being started. Stand to the side so that you will not be in-line with the debris.
5. Do not grind on side of wheel unless wheel is specifically designed for such use.
6. Do not use excessive pressure while grinding.
7. Report to a mentor immediately any cracked, broken or otherwise defective wheels.
8. Have a mentor mount and balance new wheels.
9. Keep the grinding wheel dressed. Dressing a small amount frequently is better than having to dress a lot later and will allow the wheel to cut faster, cooler and with a better surface finish. Dressing is cleaning and smoothing the surface of the grinding wheel.
10. Hold work securely while grinding, use the toolrest to support the work when off-hand grinding on bench or pedestal grinders.
