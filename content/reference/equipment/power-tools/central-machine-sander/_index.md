## Purpose
Sanders are often use to remove small amounts of materials, such as sharp edges or rounding corners.

## Safety
1. Do not operate sanders without the guards in place.
2. On the disc sander always use the downward motion side of the disc to sand. Never the upward motion side as this can throw your part upwards with tremendous force.
3. Always attempt to place your work against the rest on the disc and belt sanders.
4. Do not operate machines with torn or ripped belts or disks.
