Here are some helpful videos and for making bumpers.

Used slippery fabric from Andymark in 2022:

- https://www.andymark.com/products/slick-blue-bumper-material-161in-x-19-5in-0-25in

When we made the 2022 bumpers we pinned:
1. the hook side of the blue velcro
2. blue fabric
3. red fabric
4. hook side red

Along one edge and ran two stiches down the edges.

Then draped the material over the bumper frame and found where the center stitch needed to be. Marked with chalk, pinned and stitched.

Then fold on the stich and mark for hook side of the velcro. Red and blue. We skipped the pins and used the chalk line.

Stretch onto bumper frame and staple. Remove material from corners so they don't look bulged out. Refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV-GEYr4fxc

Cover staples with gaff tape to hide wood.

## Noodle Welding
Didn't work great for us in 2022. Recommend using black VHB. Grey is not sticky enough.
