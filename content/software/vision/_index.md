Vision is how the Robot see the world.

There are many vision solutions available to FRC teams. Here are the ones our team found most useful:

* PixyCam - Can identify, tag, and gauge size of objects.
* Limelight - Can see reflective surfaces and measure distance towards them.
* USB Cameras - When used in tandem with OpenCV can have similar functionality to PixyCam. Also useful just to give Drivers a view on what's happening on the field.
