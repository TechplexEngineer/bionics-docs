Based on the inspiration of the [Killer Bees Battery Cart](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/killer-bees-frc-battery-cart/389013) we designed and built a wheeled parts storage cart.

This guide provides step-by-step build instructions for making your very own parts organizer rack for your robotics team. This design is made of plywood.

## A few comments on materials:
- We used 5 ply, Sande plywood from Home Depot. The Killer Bees recommend using 7 ply 3⁄4" Birch Plywood for this build. The
flatness and strength of furniture grade plywood is superior to
construction grade materials
- We recommend the Colson wheels we have listed below. These
are virtually indestructible in this high load application.
- Use a steel axle, not aluminum.
- Proper gluing of all joints is critically important.

### Spacers
To make assembly of the sliders much easier we recommend fabricating two spacers. The "Base Spacer" is used for the first slider, the other "Spacer" is to be used for all the other sliders.
