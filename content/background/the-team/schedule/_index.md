## Parts of the year
Our team generally breaks the year up into blocks
- **Preseason**    
The preseason usually starts 1 week after school starts and runs until build season starts.

- **Build Season**    
The Build Season start date is announced by FIRST and is generally the first or second Saturday in January.

- **Competition Season**
The competition season follows build season and generally starts with the "week 0" event and runs until the end of the world championships.

- **Off-season**    
Following the world championships, the off-season starts and runs until school gets out.

- **Summer**    
Usually the team does not meet.
