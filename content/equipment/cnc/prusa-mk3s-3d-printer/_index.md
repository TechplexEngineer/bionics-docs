## Purpose
3D printers create a three-dimensional object using additive manufacturing technology. The machine extrudes a plastic filament via a heated nozzle and deposits the material onto a build platform. Objects are created by laying down successive layers of material. If the printed object requires it, support structures are generated during file processing and are included in the print to help maintain accuracy.
