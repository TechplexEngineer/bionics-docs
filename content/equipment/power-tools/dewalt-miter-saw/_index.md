## Purpose
Miter saws use a rotating blade to cut through material. They produce straight and accurate cuts with the help of the installed fence. The blade is normally situated at 90° relative to the fence, but can be adjusted to the left or right by 45° to produce mitered cuts in material. Miter saws are best suited for cutting longer linear shaped stock that would otherwise present challenges to cut on a table saw.
