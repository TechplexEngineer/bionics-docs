## Purpose
Miter saws use a rotating blade to cut through material. They produce straight and accurate cuts with the help of the installed fence. The blade is normally situated at 90° relative to the fence, but can be adjusted to the left or right by 45° to produce mitered cuts in material. Miter saws are best suited for cutting longer linear shaped stock that would otherwise present challenges to cut on a table saw.

## Safety
1. Never remove or hold the guards out of the way while using the miter saw.
2. Be sure all scraps have been removed from around the blade before using saw.
3. Never allow your hands or fingers closer than 6".
4. Avoid cuting any material shorter than 8".
5. Always place material against fence, never attempt to cut anything without material firmly held in place.
6. Allow the blade to reach full speed before attempting to cut.
7. Always pull the saw and out to match the width of the material being cut before initiating cut. As the cut is being made, push saw back, this maintains control of saw and helps to prevent the saw climbing towards the user.
8. You should almost always hold the material with your left hand and control the saw with your right.
9. If you have to cut curved material, place material with curve facing out so that blade doesn’t bind during cut.
