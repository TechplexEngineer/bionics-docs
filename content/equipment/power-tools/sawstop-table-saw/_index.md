## Purpose
Table saws use a rotating blade to cut through material. They produce straight and accurate cuts with the help of the installed fence or miter gauge. The blade is normally situated at 90° relative to the table, but can be adjusted at any angle between 90°-45°. Table saws are ideal for cutting large sheets of plywood or plastic down to size. This particular table saw (SawStop) is equipped with an electronic sensor that will immediately stop the rotating blade if your finger comes into contact with it.

## Safety
1. Special training is required before using the table saw. You may not operate it without permission from a mentor and with a mentor present.
2. Stand to one side, never directly in line with, of work being fed through the saw.
3. Inspect the blade before using it, to make sure it is the proper blade and is sharp and free from cracks.
4. Never allow your fingers to get near the blade when sawing. Use a pusher stick to rip narrow pieces of stock. Don't use pusher stick to remove scrap. For scrap removal, shut off machine and wait until blade stops, then remove scraps.
5. Appropriate guards must be in place at all times. Never remove the guard. Ask one of the shop personnel for help if you think the guard is in the way.
6. If the piece of material you are cutting is large, get someone to assist in tailing-off for you. Never try to do it alone. Tailing off refers to supporting a large workpiece by supporting it underneath with your hands.
7. If you are tailing-off for someone else let them guide the work through the saw. You should just support the work without influencing the cut.
8. Never reach over the saw to obtain something from the other side.
9. When shutting off the power, never attempt to stop the saw quickly by shoving anything against the blade. Make sure the saw has stopped before leaving it.
10. Never make any adjustments to the saw while it is running. Turn off the power and make sure the saw is completely stopped before attempting to adjust it.
11. Do not allow material to collect on or around the saw table. Sweep up sawdust and material scraps regularly while working to minimize chances of slipping or stumbling.
12. Make sure that you clean up thoroughly around the saw before leaving the area. If you don't you could be the cause of someone else having an accident.
13. The circular blade of the table saw should be set to 1/8 inch above the work.
