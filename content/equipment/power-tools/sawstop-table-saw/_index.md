## Purpose
Table saws use a rotating blade to cut through material. They produce straight and accurate cuts with the help of the installed fence or miter gauge. The blade is normally situated at 90° relative to the table, but can be adjusted at any angle between 90°-45°. Table saws are ideal for cutting large sheets of plywood or plastic down to size. This particular table saw (SawStop) is equipped with an electronic sensor that will immediately stop the rotating blade if your finger comes into contact with it.
