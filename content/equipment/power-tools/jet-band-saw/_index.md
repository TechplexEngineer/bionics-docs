## Purpose
Band saws are powered saws that use a continuously toothed blade to cut material. The continuous blade is stretched between two wheels that rotate when the machine is powered and drive the blade. This machine is often used to cut oversized stock material into smaller pieces that are more manageable on higher precision machines. The material is fed into the blade by hand.

## Safety
1. Before use, confirm that the blade is on the wheels and that it is properly tensioned.
2. Adjust the upper guide (the one above the table) to about 1/4" above the stock before turning on the saw.
3. Avoid pulling stock in the reverse direction. This will likely result in the blade coming off the wheels. If a situation develops where the blade is binding or burning, stop, turn off the power and wait until the blade stops moving, then carefully remove the work.
4. If the blade breaks under use, stop the motor immediately and wait until the wheels stop moving, then remove the stock and replace the blade.
5. Avoid make adjustments to the blade guide while the blade is moving.
6. Maintain a 4" margin of safety between your fingers and the moving saw blade.
7. Keep both upper and lower doors closed while using the saw.
8. Never try to saw round stock (small logs or dowels) unless they are securely fastened in a V-block or special log jig (sled).
9. For long curved cuts, plan a series of relief cuts perpendicular to the curve. The relief cuts help to minimize the need to back-out of curved cuts.
10. If you hear funny noises (such as squeals), stop the saw and inspect blade and wheels.
