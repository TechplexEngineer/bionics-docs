## Purpose
Milling machines use the rotational motion of a stationary cutter to remove material from a workpiece. The position of the workpiece can be moved along all 3 of the machines working axes (X, Y, and Z). By advancing the workpiece into the rotating cutter, material is removed, and it is brought to the desired size and shape.

## Safety
1. Remove the collet tightening wrench immediately after using it.
2. Work must be clamped securely in a vise and vise clamped tightly to the table, or, work must be clamped securely to the table.
3. Make sure cutter is rotating in the proper direction before cutting material.
4. Before running machine the spindle should be rotated by hand to make sure it is clear for cutting.
5. Make sure the power is off before changing cutters.
6. Make sure that the machine is fully stopped before taking any measurements.
7. Always use cutters which are sharp and in good condition.
8. Always stay at the machine while it is running.
9. Use the milling machine spindle brake to stop the spindle after the power has been turned off.
10. Before cleaning the mill remove cutting tools from the spindle to avoid cutting yourself.
