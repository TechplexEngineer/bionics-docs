## Purpose
Milling machines use the rotational motion of a stationary cutter to remove material from a workpiece. The position of the workpiece can be moved along all 3 of the machines working axes (X, Y, and Z). By advancing the workpiece into the rotating cutter, material is removed, and it is brought to the desired size and shape.
