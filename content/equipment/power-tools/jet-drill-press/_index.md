## Purpose
A drill press is a machine designed to produce holes. They use the rotational motion of a bit, secured in a spindle, to remove material and produce a hole in a work piece. Drill presses operate on a similar premise to hand drills, but they have more power and use a table to support the workpiece while drilling. Generally, the table is situated perpendicularly to the spindle, which ensures that the placement of holes is perpendicular to the top surface of a workpiece. However, the table has the ability to tilt to the left and right to produce holes at a preset angles.
