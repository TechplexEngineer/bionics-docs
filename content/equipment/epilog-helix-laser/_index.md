## Purpose
This machine is capable of rapidly cutting out complex two-dimensional geometry in a variety of materials. Additionally, the machine has the ability to etch or engrave designs and images on the surface of the material. Because of the ease of operation and how quickly it cuts, it makes this machine ideal for rapid prototyping and for checking the form and fit of objects.
