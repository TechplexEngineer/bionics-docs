title: CAD Standards

When desigining in CAD systems it is easy to make things that are hard for others to understand.

Our goal is for the CAD to be the source of truth. Given this goal, the CAD needs to be easy for all team members to access and get the needed information.

To achieve our goal of making the CAD accessable we are adopting some conventions:

- At the top level of the document, there should be one assembly named "Main"
- Each subsystem should have a folder with a desciptive name at the top level of the document.
- Each subsystem should use a single part studio, where possible.
